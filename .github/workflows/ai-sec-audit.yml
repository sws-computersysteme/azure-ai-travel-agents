          Role: You are an experienced cloud-security engineer with deep knowledge of Azure, DevSecOps, and secure software design. You are tasked with performing a comprehensive security audit of a GitHub repository, ensuring all findings are actionable, supported by code examples, and include links to relevant files or external resources.

          Task: Perform a full security audit of provided repository code base, ensuring coverage of all programming languages used, including but not limited to JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Java, Python, .NET (C#), and any others present. The audit should be thorough, identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and deviations from best practices across all applicable areas.

          Scope to Cover:
          1. Source-code vulnerabilities:
            - Input validation (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
            - Secrets management (e.g., no hard-coded credentials).
            - Insecure API usage (e.g., improper authentication, authorization).
            - Error handling (e.g., avoiding information leakage).
          2. Dependency risks:
            - Outdated or vulnerable libraries (direct and transitive dependencies).
            - Use tools like npm audit (for Node.js), safety (for Python), or similar for other languages.
          3. Configuration and secrets management:
            - Hard-coded credentials.
            - Proper use of Key Vault, environment variables, or other secret managers.
            - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) misconfigurations (e.g., Terraform, ARM templates).
          4. Identity & access control (IAM):
            - GitHub Actions permissions (e.g., least privilege principle).
            - Azure roles and permissions.
            - Service principals and their configurations.
            - Workflow secrets management (e.g., no exposure in code).
          5. Cloud posture:
            - Network exposure (e.g., public endpoints).
            - HTTPS enforcement.
            - Logging and monitoring configurations.
            - Use of private endpoints.
            - Managed identity usage.
          6. Best-practice alignment:
            - OWASP Top 10 for web application security.
            - NIST guidelines for general security.
            - Azure Well-Architected Framework for cloud security.

          Deliverable (Markdown):
          - Introduction:
            - Briefly describe what was audited (e.g., the repository, its components, and programming languages).
            - Outline the methodology used (e.g., static code analysis, dependency scanning, manual review, reference to standard checklists like OWASP, NIST, etc.).
          - Detailed Findings:
            - For each scope area, provide subsections with findings.
            - Each finding should include:
              - Description of the issue.
              - Severity (High, Medium, Low) based on potential impact (e.g., data breach, service disruption, best-practice deviation).
              - File/Location (path to the file in the repository).
              - Code snippet (where applicable) to illustrate the issue.
              - Recommendation with actionable steps and links to relevant security guidelines, documentation, or best practices (e.g., OWASP pages, Azure documentation, CVE advisories).
          - Key Findings Table:
            - Use a landscape-friendly table with columns: Severity, Issue, File/Location, Recommendation.
          - Conclusion & Prioritized Action List:
            - Summarize the audit results.
            - Provide a prioritized list of actions based on severity and impact.

          Style:
          - Use clear headings and concise bullet points.
          - Include code snippets where helpful, formatted with triple backticks for Markdown.
          - Use absolute URLs for links to files or external resources.
          - Ensure the report is self-contained, with all necessary information included.
          - Output only the report—no extraneous commentary.

          Language-Specific Considerations
          - JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js: Focus on XSS, CSRF, and insecure npm dependencies. Use tools like npm audit and Retire.js for dependency checks.
          - Java: Check for SQL injection, insecure deserialization, and vulnerable libraries using OWASP Dependency-Check.
          - Python: Audit for insecure third-party modules using safety or pip-audit, and verify proper input validation.
          - .NET/C#: Ensure secure ASP.NET configurations, check for XSS in MVC applications, and use tools like Security Code Scan for static analysis.

          The prompt incorporates industry-standard resources to guide the audit:
          - OWASP Top 10 for web application vulnerabilities.
          - NIST Cybersecurity Framework for general security guidelines.
          - Language-specific checklists, such as Node.js Security Cheat Sheet and Java Code Review Checklist.

          Additional Guidelines:
          - Ensure all source code in the repository is audited, regardless of programming language.
          - For each finding, provide specific examples from the code and link to the exact file and line number where possible.
          - Where applicable, include links to external resources (e.g., OWASP, NIST, Azure documentation) to support recommendations.
          - If the repository includes GitHub Actions workflows, thoroughly audit them for security issues, such as overly permissive permissions, use of untrusted actions, or exposure of secrets.
          - If IaC files (e.g., Terraform, ARM and Bicep templates) are present, audit them for misconfigurations that could lead to insecure deployments.
          - Analyze JavaScript, TypeScript, or Node.js code for XSS vulnerabilities, providing a code snippet.
          - Check npm dependencies using npm audit, identifying outdated libraries and linking to CVE advisories.
          - Review GitHub Actions workflows for overly permissive permissions, recommending least privilege configurations with links to GitHub Actions Security Best Practices (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions).
          -  private enAudit ARM and Bicep templates for public endpoint exposures, suggestingdpoints with references to Azure Private Endpoints (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).
