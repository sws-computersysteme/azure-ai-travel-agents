## Overview

The AI Travel Agents is a robust **enterprise application** that leverages multiple **AI agents** to enhance travel agency operations. The application demonstrates how LlamaIndex.TS orchestrates **multiple AI agents** to assist employees in handling customer queries, providing destination recommendations, and planning itineraries. Multiple **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) servers, built with **Python, Node.js, Java and .NET**, are used to provide various tools and services to the agents, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

| Agent Name                       | Purpose                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Query Understanding** | Extracts key **preferences** from customer inquiries.                                                                         |
| **Destination Recommendation**   | Suggests **destinations** based on customer preferences.                                                                          |
| **Itinerary Planning**           | Creates a detailed **itinerary** and travel plan.                                                                                 |
| **Code Evaluation**              | Executes custom logic and scripts when needed.                                                                                  |
| **Model Inference**              | Runs a custom **LLM** using **ONNX** and **vLLM** on **Azure Container Apps' serverless GPU** for high-performance inference. |
| **Web Search**                   | Uses Grounding with Bing Search to fetch live travel data.                                                                    |
| **Echo Ping**                    | Echoes back any received input (used as an MCP server example).                                                               |

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture of the AI Travel Agents application is designed to be modular and scalable:

- All components are containerized using **Docker** so that they can be easily deployed and managed by **[Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/)**.
- All agents tools are available as MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) servers and are called by the MCP clients.
- MCP servers are implemented independently using variant technologies, such as **Python**, **Node.js**, **Java**, and **.NET**.
- The Agent Workflow Service orchestrates the interaction between the agents and MCP clients, allowing them to work together seamlessly.
- The Aspire Dashboard is used to monitor the application, providing insights into the performance and behavior of the agents (through the [OpenTelemetry integration](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/integrations/)).

## Features
- Multiple AI agents (each with its own specialty)
- Orchestrated by [LlamaIndex.TS](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/)
- Supercharged by [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
- Deployed serverlessly via [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/)
- Includes an [llms.txt](./llms.txt) file to provide information to help LLMs use this project at inference time ([learn more](https://llmstxt.org/))


## Preview the application locally for FREE

To run and preview the application locally, we will use [Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Phi4 14B model requires **significant resources** (at least 16GB RAM and a modern CPU or GPU) to run efficiently. 
GPU acceleration is only supported on macOS Apple Silicon and NVIDIA GPUs on Windows). 
> If your machine does not have enough resources to run LLMs locally, you can still run the application using Azure AI Foundry. Please refer to the [Advanced Setup](docs/advanced-setup.md) documentation for more information.

### One setup script

The script will do the following:
- Run a check for the required tools and dependencies
- Clone the current repository to your local machine
- Install npm dependencies for the API and web app
- Download the [Phi4 14B model](https://hub.docker.com/r/ai/phi4)
  - This will take a while, as the model is large (around 7.80 GB)
- Build the Docker images for all the MCP servers
- Configure all the .env files with the correct settings for local AX

```

**[Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)** is needed to run the script. **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to [upgrade PowerShell](https://aka.ms/PSWindows).

## Cost estimation

When provisioning resources in Azure, it's important to consider the costs associated with running the application. The AI Travel Agents sample uses several Azure services, and the costs can vary based on your usage and configuration.

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/10e328d3aa074a5089a5ae6c1fb65ba9) for the resources below to get an estimate.

- Azure Container Apps: Consumption plan, Free for the first 2M executions. Pricing per execution and memory used. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
- Azure Container Registry: Free for the first 2GB of storage. Pricing per GB stored and per GB data transferred. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, GPT model. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per query. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure Monitor: Free for the first 5GB of data ingested. Pricing per GB ingested after that. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down --purge` (see [Clean up](#clean-up)).

## Quick deploy the sample to Azure

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project.
2. Authenticate with Azure by running `azd auth login`.
3. Run `azd up` to deploy the application to Azure. This will provision Azure resources, deploy this sample, with all the containers, and set up the necessary configurations.
   - You will be prompted to select a base location for the resources. If you're unsure of which location to choose, select `swedencentral`.
   - By default, the OpenAI resource will be deployed to `swedencentral`. You can set a different location with `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>`. Currently only a short list of locations is accepted. That location list is based on the [OpenAI model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions) and may become outdated as availability changes.

The deployment process will take a few minutes. Once it's done, you'll see the URL of the web app in the terminal.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/azd-up.png" alt="Screenshot of the azd up command result" width="600px" />
</div>

You can now open the web app in your browser and start chatting with the bot.

## Clean up

To clean up all the Azure resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down --purge`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.

## Advanced Setup

To run the application in a more advanced local setup or deploy to Azure, please refer to the troubleshooting guide in the [Advanced Setup](docs/advanced-setup.md) documentation. This includes setting up the Azure Container Apps environment, using local LLM providers, configuring the services, and deploying the application to Azure.
